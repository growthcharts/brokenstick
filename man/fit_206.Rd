\title{Broken stick model fitted on 206 children}
\format{
An object of class \code{brokenstick}, fitted by the
\code{brokenstick()}. This is an \code{lmerMod} object with additional
slots:
\describe{
\item{knots}{A vector of internal knots used by \code{make_basis()}}
\item{boundary}{The boundary knots of the linear spline}
\item{degree}{The degree of the spline. The brokenstick model corresponds to \code{degree = 1}.}
\item{bs.call}{An object of class \code{call} representing the call that was used to construct the object.}
\item{xy}{A data frame with column names \code{subjid}, \code{x} and \code{y} containing the data on which the model was fitted when called by the call in slot \code{bs.call}.}
}
}
