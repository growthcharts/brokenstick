Description: The broken stick model describes a set of individual curves by a
    linear mixed model using first order linear B-splines. The main use of the model
    is to align irregularly observed data to a user-specified grid of break ages.
    All fitting can done in the Z-score scale, so nonlinearities and irregular data
    can be treated as separate problems. This package contains functions for fitting
    a broken stick model to data, for exporting the parameters of the model for
    independent use outside this package, and for predicting broken stick curves for
    new data.
