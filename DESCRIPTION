Title: Broken Stick Model for Irregular Longitudinal Data
Version: 2.0.0
Authors@R: person("Stef", "van Buuren", email = "stef.vanbuuren@tno.nl", role = c("aut","cre"))
Description: The broken stick model describes a set of individual curves by a
    linear mixed model using a second-order linear B-spline. The main use of the model
    is to align irregularly observed data to a user-specified grid of break ages.
    All fitting can done in the Z-score scale, so non-linearity and irregular data
    can be treated as separate problems. This package contains functions for fitting
    a broken stick model to data, for predicting broken stick curves in new data,
    and for plotting the broken stick estimates. For additional documentation on 
    background, methodology and applications of the broken stick model see
