Title: Broken Stick Model for Irregular Longitudinal Data
Version: 0.77.0
Authors@R: person("Stef", "van Buuren", email = "stef.vanbuuren@tno.nl", role = c("aut","cre"))
Description: The broken stick model describes a set of individual curves by a
    linear mixed model using first order linear B-splines. The main use of the model
    is to align irregularly observed data to a user-specified grid of break ages.
    All fitting can done in the Z-score scale, so nonlinearities and irregular data
    can be treated as separate problems. This package contains functions for fitting
    a broken stick model to data, for predicting broken stick curves in new data,
    and for plotting the estimates.
