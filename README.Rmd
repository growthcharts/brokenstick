# brokenstick

The broken stick model describes a set of individual curves by a linear mixed model using first order linear B-splines. The main use of the model is to align irregularly observed data to a user-specified grid of break ages.

All fitting can done in the Z-score scale, so nonlinearities and irregular data can be treated as separate problems. This package contains functions for fitting a broken stick model to data, for exporting the parameters of the model for independent use outside this package, and for predicting broken stick curves for new data.

## Installation

The `brokenstick` package can be installed from GitHub as follows: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stefvanbuuren/brokenstick")
```

There is currently no CRAN version.

## Overview

The *broken stick model* describes a set of individual curves by a linear mixed model using first order linear B-splines. The model can be used

- to smooth growth curves by a series of connected straight lines;
- to align irregularly observed curves to a common age grid;
- to create synthetic curves at a user-specified set of break ages;
- to estimate the time-to-time correlation matrix;
- to predict future observations.

The user specifies a set of break ages at which the straight lines connect. Each individual obtains an estimate at each break age, so the set of estimates of the individual form a smoothed version of the observed trajectory. 

The main assumptions of the broken stick model are: 

- The development between the break ages follows a straight line, and is generally not of particular interest;
- Broken stick estimates follow a common multivariate normal distribution;

In order to conform to the assumption of multivariate normality, the user may fit the broken stick model on suitably transformed data that yield the standard normal ($Z$) scale. Unique feature of the broken stick model are:

- *Modular*: Issues related to nonlinearities of the growth curves in the observed scale can be treated separately, i.e., outside the broken stick model;
- *Local*: A given data point will contribute only to the estimates corresponding to the closest break ages;
- *Exportable*: The broken stick model can be exported and reused for prediction for new data in alternative computing environments.

The `brokenstick` package contains functions for

- Fitting the broken stick model to data,
- Plotting individual trajectories,
- Predicting broken stick estimates for new data.
