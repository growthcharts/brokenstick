<p>This vignette shows a step-by-step introduction of how to - Fit the broken stick model to data; - Predict observations by the fitted model.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#get-the-data" class="anchor"></a>Get the data</h2>
<p>This vignette assumes the <code>rbokeh</code>, <code>AGD</code>, <code>brokenstick</code> packages are installed. See <a href="gettingstarted.html">getting started with <code>brokenstick</code></a> for the installation procedure. We will use the <code>smocc_200</code> demo data that is built-in into the <code>brokenstick</code> package.</p>
</div>
<div id="calculate-z-scores" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#calculate-z-scores" class="anchor"></a>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-scores</h2>
<p>The broken stick model can fit observations in either the raw scale (cm, kg, and so on) or as a standard deviation score (SDS), or <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score. The results from the analysis of the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score is preferable for several reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>for growth curves, a straight line assumption is more plausible in the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score scale;</li>
<li>the assumption of normality is more plausible in the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score scale;</li>
<li>fitting the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score data leads to less convergence issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is easy to convert the measurements into the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score scale, fit the model, and convert back to the raw scale afterwards, if desired. There are several <code>R</code> packages that assist in the calculations: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AGD/index.html">AGD</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/anthro/index.html">anthro</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/childsds/index.html">childsds</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ki-tools/growthstandards">growthstandards</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zscorer/index.html">zscorer</a>.</p>
<p>Here we use 200 children from the SMOCC data <span class="citation">[@herngreen1994]</span>. The <code>smocc_200</code> data contains the height measurement both in the original scale in cm (<code>hgt</code>) and the Z-score scale (<code>hgt.z</code>) as calculated against the growth references of the Fourth Dutch Growth study <span class="citation">[@fredriks2000]</span>.</p>

Height SDS by age (years) for 50 children of SMOCC.

<p>Figure x shows an alternative representation of the same data by replacing height by height SDS. This figure reveals additional detail.</p>
<p>Note that the data contain some outliers, especially at the lower end. For example, child 10059 was born after a gestational age of 34 weeks and has several extremely low SDS values. Child 10023 was born after 32 weeks of gestation.</p>

<p>The SMOCC study had 10 scheduled visits: at birth, and at ages of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months. Here, we are interested in estimating what the most likely value would have been had the visit occured exactly on the schedules age. We therefore place the knots at the scheduled ages.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the properties of the brokenstick model, the first knot should coincide with the left boundary knot (here 0), while the right boundary (here 3) must exceed than the maximum age in the data.</p>
<p>Note that this is not the only way to set knots. Depending of the scientific question at hand, we could place vary the number of knots, or place them at different locations. See the vignette on <a href="https://stefvanbuuren.name/brokenstick/articles/knotplacement.html">knot placement</a> for a discussion of various options.</p>

<p>The result is stored in the <code>fit</code> object, which has S4 class <code>brokenstick</code>. It extends class <code>lmerMod</code> with additional attributes <code>knots</code>, <code>boundary</code> and <code>degree</code>. By design, the <code><a href="../reference/brokenstick.html">brokenstick()</a></code> function only supports a one spline degree, the straight line model.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the <code><a href="../reference/brokenstick.html">brokenstick()</a></code> function calls <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/lme4/man/lmer.html">lme4::lmer()</a></code> for performing the calculations. Depending on the number of knots, the fitting algorithm may issue warnings about the number of random effect (too high), or reports the random-effects parameters or residual variance are probably unidentifiable. Despite these warnings, the estimated random effects are still useable, and in fact a good summary of the individual trajectories. Alternatively, the user may wish to simplify the model by removing knots. Above 10 knots, fitting becomes hard. At the least, the user should check the fitted object for plausibility, for example by plotting observed and modelled trajectories together.</p>

<p>The column labeled <code>Std.Dev.</code> contains the standard deviations of the random effects. These numbers are expected to be around 1, since - under the assumption that Dutch reference appropriately describes this sample - the dependent variable <code>hgt.z</code> follows a standard normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation equal to one. The <code>Corr</code> component of the random effects lists the correlations between the broken stick estimates at different ages. The correlation matrix shows a typically pattern where the highest elements are close to the diagonal, and where off-diagonal elements decrease. The standard deviation of the residuals (within-person error) for this model is of 0.19, so on average, the discrepancy between observed and fitted trajectories is about one fifth of a standard deviation. At the age of 2 years, the standard deviation in height is about 32 mm, so on average the difference between the model and the observed data is about 6-7 mm.</p>

<p>produces the predicted value (in <code>yhat</code>) for each measured data point for all children used to fit the model in the <code>long</code> output format. The observed <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score is stored in column called <code>y</code>, and the corresponding broken stick estimates are stored in the column called <code>yhat</code>. The column <code>knot</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> if the row corresponds to a knot, and to <code>FALSE</code> if <code>y</code> is actually observed.</p>
<p>The predicted values represent a compromise between the personâ€™s data values and the global mean. In general, the fewer and less extreme data points of a person are, the closer the compromise will be toward the global mean. The compromise is called the <em>conditional mean</em> of the posterior distribution. In the broken stick model, it is simply calculated as the sum of the fixed and random effects.</p>
<p>We can obtain the locations at which the lines connect by specifying the <code>at = "knots"</code> argument, e.g.</p>

<p>A brokenstick model like in <code>fit</code> can be stored by <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/save.html">save()</a></code> for future use in R. However, this is a fairly large object that contains a lot of superfluous information. As a matter of fact, if we know the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables of a given person, prediction using the broken stick model requires only the knot locations, the fixed effect estimates, the variance/covariance matrix of the random effects, and the size of the residual variance.

<p>The figure below plots the observed data (five blue points) and the broken stick predictions (red points) for Fred.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus, based on the data up to 1.1 year, the model predicts that Fredâ€™s growth curve would remain around -2.0 SD until Fred is 1.5 years, and then would increase to -1.5 SD.</p>
