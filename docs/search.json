Timing variation can substantial observational studies, especially survey lacks pre-specified schedule. Longitudinal data timing differences subjects said irregular. Irregular observation times present significant challenges quantitative analysis. example, isn’t easy calculate time--time correlation matrix data spread thinly time. might also complex predict future past data subject times differ. Observation times may also relate process interest. example, severe patients get frequent measurements; unmotivated cohort members respond rarely, . Conventional methods like MANOVA, regression cluster analysis break observation times differ drop-selective. irregular observation times occur science, universal principled approach resolve problem. One straightforward fix take dates data available (e.g., dates stocks traded), thus ignoring times markets closed. One may also create bins time intervals around planned times, thereby ignoring within-period differences. Another ad-hoc method predicts value scheduled time neighbouring data, e.g., linear interpolation smoothing, typically reducing variability data. quick fixes create data sets timing problem seems “gone away,” may tempt analyst ignore potential effects data patch-substantive conclusions. convenient straightforward, thoughtless application fixes introduces significant spurious relations time, especially spacing observations highly irregular.(Rehfeld et al. 2011) Binning can lead “surprisingly large” biases.(Towers 2014) timing variation related outcome interest, methods may result biased estimates exaggerated claims.(Pullenayegum Lim 2016) linear mixed model longitudinal data (Laird Ware 1982; Fitzmaurice, Laird, Ware 2011) standard analysing irregular data. model represents subject’s observed curve parametric function time. parameter estimates function specific subject modelled random effects. linear mixed model beneficial irregular data. borrows strength across different realisations process, summarising trajectory small number parameters vary subjects. analyst can break distribution random effects function individual characteristics. linear mixed model attractive number measurements differs individuals measurements taken different times. paper explores use broken stick model transform irregularly observed data repeated measures. broken stick model describes curve series connected straight lines. model long history known many names, amongst others, segmented straight lines (Bellman Roth 1969), piecewise regression (Toms Lesperance 2003), structural change models (Bai Perron 2003), broken line smoothing (Koutsoyiannis 2000) segmented regression (Lerman 1980). term broken stick goes back least MacArthur (1957), used analogy indicate abundance species. literature broken stick model concentrates problem finding optimal times lines connect. Instead, present paper focus problem summarising irregular individual trajectories estimates made pre-specified time grid. time grid identical individuals, needs equidistant. model formulation special case linear mixed model, time modelled set random effects coded linear \\(B\\)-spline subjects grouping factor. output transformation set repeated measures, every subject obtains score every time point. Many R packages offer tools interpolation. splines package ( Core Team 2020) akima package (Akima et al. 2021) contains classic interpolation methods one- two-dimensional smoothing. contributed packages concentrate time series spatial interpolation. See Li Heap (2014) Lepot, Aubin, Clemens (2017) overviews different concepts methodologies. interpolation techniques rely neighbouring information, time, space . broken stick model addresses problem many independent replications provide short irregular multivariate time series, say 5-30 time points. scientific interest dynamically predict update future observations. model applies linear mixed model increase stability series borrowing information across replicates. satisfactory solutions problem, brokenstick package intends fill gap. Substantive researchers often favour repeated measures use linear mixed models simplicity. example, can easily fit subject-level model predict future outcomes conditional earlier data repeated measures data. simple regression models may less efficient modelling complete data (Diggle et al. 2002, sec. 6.1), increased insight may valuable increased precision. broken stick model requires specification sensible set time points measurements ideally taken. subject, model predicts imputes hypothetical observations times, substantive analysis applies repeated measures instead irregular data. strategy akin Diggle’s multi-stage approach model-fitting approach (Diggle 1988). envisioned two-step analytic process aims provide best worlds. applications broken stick model : approximate individual trajectories series connected straight lines; align irregularly observed curves joint age grid; impute realisations individual trajectories; estimate time--time correlation matrix; predict future observations. original motivation developing broken stick model facilitate statistical analysis testing critical ages onset childhood obesity (de Kroon et al. 2010), extensions multiple imputation (van Buuren 2018b). good support R fitting child growth data. mention related approaches.
